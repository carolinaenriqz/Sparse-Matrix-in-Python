# Sparse Matrix Utilities in Python
This repository focuses on solving numerical problems using sparse matrices in Python. It includes implementations for boundary value problems (BVP) and matrix operations optimized with scipy.sparse. You'll find examples of LU decomposition and efficient handling of large sparse systems for scientific computing.
